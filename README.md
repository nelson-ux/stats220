### Short Description
The main task here is to create our meme without any limitations on topics! So [*click here*](https://nelson-ux.github.io/stats220/) to see the meme that i created by using R. My codes are also included, so if you like it feel free to use it to make your own memes! Code descriptions are added so it will be easy for you to understand and make adjustments on the codes. However, the R package [*magick*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) is used so you may need to install this in on your Computer to run my code. 

Have Fun Coding!!!
